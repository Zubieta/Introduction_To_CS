##Introduction to CS Course Project & Homework
This is the material from the first course in the CS Undergraduate Program, which was done in **Java** for learning *Object-Oriented Programming* notions, there were some exercises and homework to do in **Java**, but I chose to do some of then in **C++** for personal learning purposes. This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.


###Course Project - Crashballs
The project we were tasked to do is a clone of the game *[Crash Balls](http://www.blackberryrc.com/uploads/allimg/110501/1-1105012334130-L.jpg)* for BlackBerry. A key difference (or a crazy spin) I put into it is a bar at the top that gets lower a bit every time a move is done, so that the difficulty increases since the upper limit a piece can reach before losing (just like tetris) is coming down, slowly but surely.
