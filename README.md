##Introduction to CS Course Project & Homework
This is the material from the first course in the CS Undergraduate Program, which was done in **Java** for learning *Object-Oriented Programming* notions, there were some exercises and homework to do in **Java**, but I chose to do some of then in **C++** for personal learning purposes. This was made for educational purposes and is licensed under the **MIT License**.

The project is a clone of the game 'Crash Balls' for Blackberry, which has contains an user guide.
